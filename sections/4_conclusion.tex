While this analysis does not cover all of Wong Kar Wai's filmography, it is evident that Wong kar Wai offers something unique and special when it comes to storytelling. His films often feature a slice of life perspective of their protagonists and utilize cinematography as well as narrative techniques to immerse the viewer in their world for a brief amount of time. The films often have no moral or larger story but instead revel in individual character interactions and the beauty of the urban landscape.

Although themes such as unrequited love are common between Wong Kar Wai's films, each film remains distinct from its peers and shows us different aspects of the lives of characters that have to manage navigating urban spaces and their relationships in a world where they are not the main character but instead have to grapple with situations and circumstances out of their control.
